- **Data Storage:** All holdings and portfolio data stored in PostgreSQL.  
- **Smart Parsing:** Extracts ISIN, company/fund name, and holding values using regex and structured parsing logic.  
- **Dynamic Dashboard:** Displays equity, mutual fund, and overall portfolio values in visual cards and charts.  
- **Portfolio History:** Tracks total value of each uploaded portfolio by portfolio ID.  
- **Cross-Origin Session Support:** Flask sessions persist across React frontend via Flask-Session and CORS.

## How It Works
User Login/Register:
- Credentials are verified and a session is created in Flask.
- Upload ECAS PDF:
- User uploads a PDF via the React form (optional password supported).
- PDF Parsing (Backend):
- Flask reads and parses the ECAS PDF using fitz and regex to extract structured data.
- Database Storage:
- Parsed holdings are inserted into PostgreSQL under the user‚Äôs portfolio ID.
- Dashboard Visualization:
- React fetches /dashboard-data and renders portfolio insights via charts and tables.
- History Tracking:
- The /history-data route aggregates portfolios by portfolio_id (each upload).
